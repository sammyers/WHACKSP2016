WHACK SP 2016 - GroupThinx

During this hackathon we created a web app called GroupThinx, where people struggling to make decisions could put their ideas down and rank them in a sysmatic way in order to determine the idea they liked best. This project utilized Python Flask, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. Upon visiting the page, users will be prompted to submit a group of ideas they wish to think about. An algorithm will then  create all possible combinations and allow the user to choose between ideas, such that every pair was decided. The user is then brought to  a ranking list where they can see the idea they liked the most. Our web app helps solves a confusing and sometimes complicated problem by breaking it down to small parts. The idea is to help facilitate brainstorming and decision making such that people can make choices in their lives and be more productive. A person with a direction and sense of purpose if a happy person.
